				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This program generates MadLibs dynamically using the 30 unique beginnings, middles, and ends of the madlibs. It prompts the user to type in a grammar type and then inserts that into the madlib sentence.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The program uses basic array structures and a state machine to handle all of the data processing and user inputs. To keep track of the final sentence we slowly add to an array of characters as the user types in more words. I explored using Tracery for this project but it was not the right fit.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>My original idea was to have a visual slot machine mechanic that picks the words in the sentence for you, but I found this to be very boring and not a true madlib recreation. So after reflecting and talking with the professor I decided to explore using Tracery and allowing the user to input their own words into the program. That's what I ended up doing but ended up not using tracery, I spent time getting it setup and realized it wasn't the right fit for this project since I needed to have user inputs and the program itself wasn't that complicated.</p>
