				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this project I set out to create a day and night cycle that interated through the moons in order. As I worked on the project I decided to add more and more detail.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The sun and moon use a geometry equation to rotate around the screen in a circle at opposite ends. I use this equation to also change the colors on the screen to darken the screen during night time. I created a cloud class that can easily create clouds and move them individually, and then deletes them when they move off the screen. The stars are an array of coordinates that I draw circles on during the night time, and the brightness of the stars are based on the time of night and which moon phase is currently active.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project came with a lot of frustration, but I'm proud of the end result. What I started with was very simple but I turned it into something unique and it looks pretty good. There are some things I will probably fix in the future, like how the stars don't fade out or how the shadows are directly under the clouds and don't consider the light source position. The code could also be better organized, which I may fix at a future date. Overall though I'm happy with this project and I might even upload it to p5.js because I couldn't find many Day/Night cycles that looked good.</p>
