				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this experiment I wanted to utilize the camera to allow the user to create their own piece of art. I also wanted to make it play like a game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used the p5.js camera capture feature, with ml5's hand detection algorithm to track the players index finger around the screen. I flipped the canvas so that when the user moves their hand left, the cursor moves left. As the user moves around the screen I add coordinates to a array that I will then print at the end of the game. I added obstacles that move around the screen, spawn randomly, and detect collision. They also disable once off the screen. Lastly I added a filter to give the project a more retro feel.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Flipping the canvas caused a lot of pain later on in the project when I had to handle collision. Collision had a lot of issues, and maybe it wasn't the best idea for this project. Creating a drawing system that uses your hands was a lot of fun. I went through many iterations of what the drawing circles actually looked like, but I'm happy with the static but alternating color pattern I ended up with.</p>
