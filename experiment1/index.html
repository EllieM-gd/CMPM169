				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I wanted to create a piece of art that would react to the users mouse position. I ended up getting an idea to make everything ants and I wanted the user to never be able to make contact with the ants no matter how hard they try.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Most of my struggles on this experiment came from the setup process as this was my first experiment. I created a grid of ants that is redrawn every frame. I had to use some triginometry to calculate the distance and angle the ants need to move away from the cursor. Theoretically the ants and cursor should never overlap if the program is in normal operation. I also attempted to make all the other ants far from the cursor move slightly towards the mouse from their original positions, but the effect is minimal.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The main struggle in this project was getting everything setup. After that it was all smooth sailings. I had the idea of making sure the cursor couldn't touch the ants, and the idea seemed to worked very well on basically the first try. I hope since now I know how to get everything setup I will be able to make better more complex art for the next experiments.</p>
