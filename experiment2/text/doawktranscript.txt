RODRICK: 
Greg? 
GREG: 
Mmm. 
Greg? 
What? 
Greg! 
Huh? 
What? 
What 
are 
you
doing? 
Get
up! 
Mom 
and 
Dad 
have 
been 
calling 
you 
for 
an 
hour. 
You're 
about 
to 
be 
late 
for 
your 
first 
day 
of 
middle 
school. 
What? 
Oh, 
geez! 
How 
did 
THAT
 happen? 
 Go, 
 go, 
 go! 
 Mom's 
 about 
 to 
 flip 
 out! 
 She 
 sent 
 me 
 to 
 get 
 you 
 while 
 she 
 waits 
 in 
 the 
 car! 
 What 
 are 
 you 
 doing?! 
 What's 
 going 
 on?! 
 Getting 
 ready 
 for 
 school. 
 Are 
 you 
 insane?! 
 School 
 doesn't 
 start 
 till 
 next
week. 
And 
  FYI, 
  school 
  doesn't 
  start 
  at 
  4:00 
  in 
  the 
  morning! 
  You 
  woke 
  up 
  Manny, 
  and 
  if 
  he 
  doesn't 
  go back 
  down, 
  you 
  Good 
  morning! 
  There 
  is 
  no 
  way 
  he 
  is 
  going 
  back 
  down. 
  I 
  just 
  wanted 
  to 
  sleep 
  till 
  6:00. 
  Bubby! 
  FRANK: 
  Go 
  to 
  bed. 
  I 
  got 
  him. 
  Greg, 
  what 
  are 
  you 
  doing 
  up 
  making 
  all 
  this 
  noise? 
  It 
  was 
  Rodrick! 
  He 
  woke 
  me 
  up! 
  He 
  changed 
  my 
  clock! 
  But 
  I 
  swear, 
  he 
  was 
  just...
  Go 
  to 
  bed. 
  What 
  is 
  that 
  smell? 
  I 
  can't 
  even 
  identify 
  it. 
  Bubby! 
  KIDS:
  Happy 
  Birthday! 
  Here, 
  Bubby. 
  GREG: 
  Wow! 
  Look 
  at 
  the 
  size 
  of 
  that 
  flamethrower!
  Greg:
  Okay,
  first 
  of 
  all, 
  let 
  me 
  get 
  something 
  straight.
  This 
  is 
  a 
  journal, 
  not 
  a 
  diary. 
  Yeah, 
  I 
  know 
  what 
  it 
  says 
  on 
  the 
  cover. 
  But 
  when 
  my 
  mom 
  went 
  out 
  to 
  buy 
  this 
  thing, 
  I 
  specifically 
  told 
  her 
  not 
  to 
  buy 
  one 
  that 
  said 
  "diary" 
  on 
  it. 
  This 
  just 
  proves 
  Mom 
  doesn't 
  understand 
  anything 
  about 
  kids 
  my 
  age. 
  GREG: 
  Huh? 
  Sissy! 
  Greg: 
  The 
  only 
  reason 
  I 
  agreed 
  to 
  write 
  in 
  this 
  thing 
  is 
  because 
  when 
  I'm 
  rich 
  and 
  famous 
  I'll 
  have 
  better 
  things 
  to 
  do 
  than 
  answer 
  people's 
  stupid 
  questions 
  all 
  day 
  long. 
  Gregory, 
  tell 
  us 
  about 
  your 
  childhood!
  Were 
  you 
  always 
  so 
  smart 
  and 
  handsome? 
  Here's 
  my 
  journal. 
  Now, 
  shoo, 
  shoo. 
  SUSAN: 
  That's 
  our 
  boy 
  up 
  there.
