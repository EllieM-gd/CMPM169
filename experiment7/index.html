				<h2>How to use</h2>
				<p>Type in your username and press Update. Then select any of the options, and the season(s) you'd like, to see visual representations of your stats. If you type nothing in, it will default to my stats and season 1. Click and drag the circles to compare them more easily. Please do not spam the buttons.</p>
				<p>If your data is not loading please ensure you typed your name with case-sensitivity. Please also give the server time to wake up, this could take about 50 seconds.</p>
				<p>If your data is outdated please use the Update feature to request an update, this may take up to 30 minutes before it is in effect.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>View your marvel rivals most played and highest winrate champions in a visual way. See just how much more you enjoy playing X hero over Y hero, or notice that you have a really high winrate with one friend more than another. This experiment was designed to be a fun way to easily compare playtime and winrates without needing to look at all the numbers involved.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This program is 2 parts. The first part is the API calling. I have this frontend that you are looking at right now, which calls a get request on a backend that I have hosted on a server service. This backend calls a free API which then all gets returned to this front end. The 2nd part is the front end taking that data and organizing it before creating circles to represent data values and displays them for the user.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was my first time using an API for anything so there was a learning curve for sure but I was able to figure it out and it ended up being a lot of fun! I probably could've spent more time on the UI of this project or the way the data is displayed. API's turned out to be a lot of fun though and I want to do more projects with them in the future.</p>
